# Temporal Project Structure Rule

## Purpose
Defines the required directory and documentation structure for Temporal-based workflows and workers in this repository.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure with workers as independent packages:

```
.
├── workers/                  # Root directory for all Temporal workers
│   ├── main/                 # Main worker package
│   │   ├── src/              # Source code
│   │   │   ├── activities/   # Activity implementations
│   │   │   ├── workflows/    # Workflow definitions
│   │   │   ├── index.ts      # Worker entry point
│   │   │   └── types.ts      # Worker-specific types
│   │   ├── package.json      # Worker dependencies
│   │   ├── tsconfig.json     # TypeScript configuration
│   │   └── README.md         # Worker documentation
│   └── [other-workers]/      # Additional worker packages
├── docs/                      # Project documentation
│   └── user-guide/           # User guides and documentation
├── docker-compose.yml        # Docker compose configuration
└── Dockerfile.temporal       # Base Temporal worker Dockerfile
```

All Temporal workers must be placed under `src/workers/<worker-name>/` and include:

- `workflows/` — workflow definitions for this worker
- `activities/` — activity implementations for this worker
- `index.ts` — worker entry point (registers workflows/activities, sets task queue)
- `types.ts` — (optional) worker-specific types
- `README.md` — brief usage and development instructions

Shared utilities, types, and configuration should be placed in `src/shared/`.

## Documentation

Each worker must have a dedicated documentation file at:
`docs/user-guide/temporal/workers/<worker-name>.md`

Documentation must include:

- Purpose and responsibilities of the worker
- List and description of workflows and activities
- Required environment variables
- Integration points (e.g., databases, APIs)
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## Best Practices

- Keep workflow and activity logic modular and well-tested.
- Use clear, descriptive names for workflows, activities, and task queues.
- Update documentation with every significant change to workflows or activities.
- New workers must not duplicate logic already present in shared modules.

## Enforcement

- PRs introducing new Temporal workers or workflows **must** follow this structure and update documentation accordingly.
